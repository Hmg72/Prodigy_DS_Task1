To create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a variable, we first need to examine the contents of the files provided on world bank website 
These files seem to contain population data based on their names. 
Let's start by inspecting the files to understand their structure and the variables they contain.

I'll load the contents of these files and display the first few rows to get an overview.

The provided files contain the following information:

Population Data (API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_144171.csv): This file contains population data for various countries from 1960 to 2022. Each row represents a country, and the columns include population numbers for each year.

Country Metadata (Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_144171.csv): This file includes metadata about each country, such as region and income group.

Indicator Metadata (Metadata_Indicator_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_144171.csv): This file contains information about the indicator, which in this case is "Population, total."

To create a bar chart visualizing the population distribution of a specific year, we need to:

1) Select the year for which we want to visualize the population distribution.
2) Filter and aggregate the data for that year.
3) Create the bar chart.

Let's proceed with these steps. We'll choose a recent year, such as 2021, for the visualization. ​​

The bar chart above illustrates the total population distribution by region for the year 2021. 
Each bar represents the aggregate population of countries within a specific region. 
This visualization helps to quickly compare the population sizes across different regions globally.
